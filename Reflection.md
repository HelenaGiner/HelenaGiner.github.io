<p>In conclusion, this course familiarized me with the concept of digital humanities in terms of mindful representation of data and labor. I enjoyed all aspects of this course, but the Printing in Prisons project had the most impact on my personal understanding of digital humanities as it helped me conceptualize some of the mechanisms behind societal representation which is something very important to me. Although I might have gotten different takeaways from the material than others due to focusing on a specific topic, I was glad to have explored what I did in this course and am excited to become more consciously involved in the digital humanities sphere in the future. </p>
