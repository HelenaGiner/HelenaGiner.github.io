<h1>Looking Forward Statement</h1>
<p>After this class I would like to:</p>
<ol><li>Pay attention to the sources of information that I come across online and in class. Throughout this course, as I learned more about digital and archival curation, I realized how much information is altered, misrepresented and/or condensed. For example, many cultural artifacts might not be properly represented by those describing them, and this might have further implications down the line of incorporating them into scholarship. Similarly, there are many explanations for how data was found, who found it, and how they represented it–in some cases, you don’t always know the full story and what the account is leaving out. Taking this class got me thinking about how representational sources of information actually are and I will think about this more once I explore data in scholarship. </li>
<li>Utilize the resources in the Education Commons more as a creative tool. I did not know that the resources in the Education Commons existed and were free, and since I enjoy creative work, I would be very interested in using them for future personal or even class related projects. I have talked to the staff at the ED commons and they gave me some steps regarding who to contact and what to do to be able to use the resources, and I plan to follow up with this next semester.</li>
<li>Polish up my digital website curation skills. This course was the first class that I took with a computer science/coding element. Honestly, while learning these skills, I felt very over my head. It takes a long time for me to code or even remember how to do so–not to mention when I run into setbacks and how to debug those. I was considering taking a computer science course here at Penn (although I do not know if they have any easy ones for people who are somewhat technologically challenged like me). But I do think that I would like to follow some tutorials regarding website building (maybe on Youtube?) because I would like to know how to do so maybe for myself in the future.</li>
